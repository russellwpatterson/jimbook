This is a simple application I created to demonstrate a .NET Core 2 application running on Linux.

### How do I get set up? ###

I recommend creating a Xubuntu 16.04 LTS virtual machine and running through the instructions from the L&L.

Setup the VM by running the setup.sh file in the config folder.
